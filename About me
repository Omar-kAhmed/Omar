:wave:
Hey! I'm Omar Ahmed, also known as "Pixel." I am a motivated graduate of STEM High School for Boys - October 6th, and a CS freshman at the University of Debrecen, Class of 2025. For my spirit, I see that “Truth can only be found in one place: the code.”. Therfore, I have deticated my time for learning these powerful letters. I enjoy taking on leadership responsibilities in my community and have acquired excellent communication and organizational abilities transferable to any workplace. I'm always on the lookout for new possibilities to learn from and expand my skill set further, allowing me to become a competent, prominent software engineer at Apple corporation. Excited to construct a fantasy world by developing the foundation of any project: software.
